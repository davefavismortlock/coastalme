; This is the sediment input event data file.
;
; The associated shapefile stores a location and ID for each sediment input event.
;
; If "Sediment input at exact location or at nearest point on coast?" in the main input file is set to L ("Location")
; then the sediment block is simply placed, at the time of the event, on the grid cell at this location. Values in this
; file for the "coast-normal length L" and  "along-coast-width W" of the sediment block are ignored.
;
; However if "Sediment input at exact location or at nearest point on coast?" in the main input file is set to C
; ("Coast") then CoastalME finds, at the time of the event, the nearest point on the coastline to the specified location.
; This is necessary because the coastline shifts during the simulation. Therefore it is not possible to specify, before
; the simulation begins, a location which is guaranteed to be exactly on the coastline at a given time. The sediment
; input in this case is assumed to be in the shape of a rectangular block. This block has uniform thickness (height),
; extends a length L into the sea (normal to the coastline), and has an along-coastline width W.
;
; Each row below contains data for a single sediment input event, and must include the following comma-separated values:
;  * the location ID of the sediment input event (same as the ID in the shapefile. IDs start from 1 and must run
;    consecutively)
;  * the timing of the sediment input event. This can be either relative (i.e. a number of hours or days after the
;    simulation start) or absolute (i.e. a time/date in the format hh-mm-ss dd/mm/yyyy)
;  * the volume (m3) of fine sediment in the sediment block
;  * the volume (m3) of sand sediment in the sediment block
;  * the volume (m3) of coarse sediment in the sediment block
;  * the coast-normal length L (m) of the sediment block (ignored if sediment input is at exact location)
;  * the along-coast width W (m) of the sediment block (ignored if sediment input is at exact location).
;
; Rows may be in any sequence. If more than one sediment input event occurs simultaneously (i.e. events occur at the
; same time at more than one location), then list each event on its own line.
